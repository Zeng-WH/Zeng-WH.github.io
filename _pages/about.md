I am **Weihao Zeng**, a PhD student supervised by [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/). starting in the fall of 2025.

## Research Interests

My main focus is on the post-training aspect of LLMs, specifically including:

- Benchmarking and improving models for long-horizon, realistic agentic tasks ([**Toolathlon**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25726))
- Improving model reasoning capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL) / self-evolution techniques ([**SimpleRL**](https://hkust-nlp.notion.site/simplerl-reason), [**B-STaR**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17256))
- Exploring efficient data engineering methods for post-training ([**Deita**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15685), [**Auto Evol-Instruct**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00770))
