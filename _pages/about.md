I am **Weihao Zeng**, a PhD student supervised by [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology starting in the fall of 2025.

My main focus is on the post-training aspect of LLMs, specifically including:

- Improving model reasoning capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL) / self-evolution techniques ([**SimpleRL**](https://hkust-nlp.notion.site/simplerl-reason), [**B-STaR**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17256))
- Exploring efficient data engineering methods for post-training ([**Deita**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15685), [**Auto Evol-Instruct**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00770))
- The application of LLMs in task-oriented dialogue systems (FutureTOD, Seen2UnSeen)

Feel free to email me for any form of academic cooperation: zengweihao96@gmail.com
