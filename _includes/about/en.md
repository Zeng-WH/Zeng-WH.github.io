I am a Master's student at the Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory([PRIS-NLP](https://pris-nlp.github.io/en/#hero)), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, advised by [Prof. Weiran Xu](https://pris-nlp.github.io/en/author/weiran-xu/). My research focuses on task-oriented dialogue systems. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the Mathematics Department of the same university. My research interests include text generation, dialogue pre-training, and task-oriented dialogue systems. I have published several papers at top conferences, including SIGIR, EMNLP, and NAACL.
